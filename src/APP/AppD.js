                                Android, the most popular open-source OS used in billions of mobile devices, has millions of applications and games available on its app store. Being present on most mobile devices it's an excellent strategy for businesses to have an android application to build authority, generate leads, and carry the business through the app itself.

                            <h4>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h4>
                            <b>1.	Why should you get a mobile app developed? Or why does anyone need a mobile application?</b>
                            <p>Today every other person on earth has a smartphone in their hand, and if you want your business to grow, a mobile application can be your best option. Over 40% of sales made on ecommerce stores are made through mobile apps as they are user-friendly, make the brand feel legit, and provide numerous functionalities.
                                Not only for sales, but a mobile app can increase efficiency and make operations easy for businesses and their clients both.
                            </p>

                            <b>2.	Should you go with an android app or iOS app development?</b>
                            <p>In the present scenario, there are more Android devices than iOS, but both are growing in numbers rapidly. And when there is an advanced technology like a hybrid or cross-platform app development available, why settle for one? We would recommend you get an app that runs on multiple platforms.
                                However, if you don't want that, you should choose the platform based upon the audience, features of the app, and similar factors.
                            </p>

                            <b>3.	Why choose Groot software for a mobile app development company?</b>
                            <p>On-time delivery and customer satisfaction are not the only factors that make us the best mobile app development company in Jaipur. Our mobile app developers are skilled in creating the most robust and functional solutions with the best UI/UX design. We develop mobile apps that are smooth and user-friendly to operate</p>

                            <b>4.	How much does it approximately cost to get a mobile app developed ?</b>
                            <p>It goes without saying that the cost of a mobile application depends upon the features and technologies integrated into the app. But to put a number, a basic mobile application could take anywhere around 10K, which again could vary from factor to factor.</p>

                            <b>5.	Which is better: A mobile app or PWA (Progressive Web App)?</b>
                            <p>Besides everything else, mobile applications have better chances to improve the sales cycle for any business and build better authority for it. Other than this, a PWA can closely challenge mobile applications because of its notable features. If you want to know about PWAs and want one developed, then you can rely on Groot Software for that also.</p>
